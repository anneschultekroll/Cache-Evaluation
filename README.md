# Scientific-Computing-Project Cache Evaluation
Program to determine the main memory bandwidth and the L1 to L3 cache sizes. 
The same data should not be used more than once to determine the bandwidth. In order to determine the cache size, however, one and the same data should be used. The hierarchy L1-L3 can be read in a diagram of memory bandwidth vs. data volume.
